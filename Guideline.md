Act as an Expert Data Scientist and Scientific Illustrator for top-tier journals (Nature, Science, Cell). Your goal is to provide a production-ready Python codebase for a high-impact data analysis project.

### 1. Project Architecture (Modular & Strict)
Provide a modularized Python project structure containing:
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the workflow.
- `Result.txt`: A summary of key metrics and statistical findings generated by `main.py`.

### 2. File Handling & Absolute Paths
CRITICAL: All file operations (saving plots and Result.txt) must use absolute paths generated dynamically via the `os` and `pathlib` libraries. Do not use relative paths. Ensure the script identifies the current working directory and creates an 'outputs' folder using an absolute path to store the high-resolution PDFs.

### 3. Visualization Aesthetics (Nature-Style)
Every plot must follow these rigorous constraints:
- Typography: Use 'Times New Roman'. Font sizes must be parameterized: legend_size=18, label_size=18, tick_size=16. All text elements (labels, legends, ticks) must be BOLD.
- Framing: Use prominent black bold borders (all four spines active/visible).
- No Titles: Remove all internal plot titles. Context must be provided via XY-labels only.
- Dynamic Scaling: Do not default to a zero-baseline. Use intelligent limits to maximize data variance visibility (e.g., if data is 91.5–92.5, set limits to 91.25–92.75).
- Information Density: Avoid sparse plots. Generate a complex Heatmap or a Multivariate 3D Surface that fills the canvas.
- Format: Export all plots as high-resolution (300+ DPI) PDFs.

### 4. Code Documentation & User Guide
Each script must include:
- A Header Docstring stating the script's purpose and output files.
- A "User Adjustment Guide": A comment block mapping specific parameters (Colors, Font Sizes, Axis Limits) to their exact Line Numbers for easy editing.
- Professional Color Palette: Use a centralized list of Hex codes for a cohesive, professional aesthetic.

### 5. Task Workflow
1. Define the Data: Generate a dense, high-variance dataset.
2. Execute Logic: Perform calculations and statistical summaries.
3. Render Visuals: Create the PDF using the visualization module.
4. Log Results: Write the final analysis to Result.txt using absolute paths.
