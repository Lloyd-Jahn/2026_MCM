# Task 1 Analysis Results (Final Model)
=======================================

## 1. Key Assumptions
1. **Payload Capacity**: Strictly Fixed at 150 tons per launch (Constant).
2. **Launch Frequency**: Increasing linearly. Each of the 10 sites adds 1 launch per year.
3. **Base Capacity**: 2050 baseline = Historical Average + 20 launches/year.
4. **Apex Logistics**: Includes transfer cost ($100/kg) from Apex Anchor to Moon surface.
5. **Preference**: AHP Parameter a=5 (Time weight: 0.8333, Cost weight: 0.1667)

## 2. Calculated Metrics
Scenario A (Scenario A):
  - Total Cost: $26,675,977,653,631.29 (26.68 Trillion)
  - Completion Time: 186.22 Years (Finish: 2236.2)
  - Initial Annual Capacity: 537,000 tons/year

Scenario B (Scenario B):
  - Total Cost: $50,511,245,048,570.50 (50.51 Trillion)
  - Completion Time: 350.65 Years (Finish: 2400.6)
  - Initial Annual Capacity: 22,950 tons/year
  - Growth Model: Quadratic (Driven by frequency increase only)

Scenario C (Scenario C):
  - Total Cost: $31,550,492,498,605.41 (31.55 Trillion)
  - Completion Time: 149.04 Years (Finish: 2199.0)
  - Initial Annual Capacity: 559,950 tons/year
  - Growth Model: Quadratic (Driven by frequency increase only)

## 3. TOPSIS Ranking Results
Rank   | Scenario   | Score      | Norm Cost    | Norm Time   
------------------------------------------------------------
1      | C          | 0.9698     | 0.4835       | 0.3514
2      | A          | 0.8182     | 0.4088       | 0.4391
3      | B          | 0.0000     | 0.7740       | 0.8268

## 4. Conclusion
The optimal strategy is **Scenario C**.
The synchronized Hybrid model offers the best balance of speed and feasibility.
